# Data C100 Final Project
This project uses data from 2020 from the USA EPA; specifically, we use data science to examine the relationship between air quality (AQI) and POC population density. In Part 1 (Questions 0-7), data is loaded in and cleaned, then used to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) where we characterize the data and formulate the questions we will answer through our model. In Part 2, we build multiple linear regression models and train them using k-fold cross validation. These models predict AQI based off of a variety of factors, and we examine whether adding racial demographic data as a variable improves or worsens our model's performance.
